# Gitwit Project

Our client has stated that their goal is to get parents to start saving at least $500 every year for college. Our problem is that our client has handed us a goal which was derived from a misunderstanding of their problem. Misunderstood problems lead to bad goals, poor solutions, and unhappy clients. We must first redefine the client goal by defining the real problem.

Problem: "Kids graduate highschool with no plan for their future."

A Better Goal: "Help parents guide children into great careers."

We accomplish this by building a badass career planning app for parents.
