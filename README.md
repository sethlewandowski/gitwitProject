# Gitwit Project

Goal: "Get parents to start saving at least $500 every year for college."

Our Problem: "Our client doesn't understand their problem."

Current Trajectory - Misidentified problems lead to bad goals, poor solutions, and unhappy clients. 

--

The Actual Problem: "Kids graduate highschool with no plan for their future."

A Better Goal: "Help parents guide children into great careers."

We accomplish this by building a badass career planning app for parents.
